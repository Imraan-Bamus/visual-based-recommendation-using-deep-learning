# Visual-Based Recommendation using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a visual-based recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The recommendation system utilizes visual information, such as images, from the Fashion Product Images Dataset to generate personalized fashion recommendations for users.

## Dataset

The Fashion Product Images Dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset). It consists of a large collection of fashion product images, along with metadata such as category, subcategory, and article type. Please download and extract the dataset to a suitable location on your machine.

## Features

- **Pretrained CNN Model**: The repository provides an implementation that leverages a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for feature extraction from fashion images. You can choose from popular pretrained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts and utilities for data preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and dataset preparation specifically tailored for the Fashion Product Images Dataset.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Tools and scripts for training the recommendation models on the fashion dataset, as well as evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing the recommendation results, such as generating recommendation lists, displaying recommended fashion items alongside their corresponding images, and creating interactive visualizations.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines and examples for deploying the trained recommendation models into production environments, including integrating them with web or mobile applications.
