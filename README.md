# Visual-Based Recommendation using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a visual-based recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The recommendation system utilizes fashion dataset to generate product recommendations for users.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: The repository provides implementations of various deep learning models for visual-based recommendation, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based models.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts and utilities for data preprocessing, including image or video feature extraction, data augmentation, and dataset preparation.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Tools and scripts for training the recommendation models on the provided datasets, as well as evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing the recommendation results, such as generating recommendation lists, displaying recommended items alongside their corresponding images or videos, and creating interactive visualizations.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines and examples for deploying the trained recommendation models into production environments, including integrating them with web or mobile applications.


## Usage

To train and evaluate a visual-based recommendation model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset: This may involve preprocessing the images or videos, extracting features, and organizing the data in a suitable format. Refer to the provided data processing scripts for guidance.

2. Choose a recommendation model: Select the deep learning model that suits your requirements from the available options. Each model may have different configuration parameters and hyperparameters, which can be customized to your specific use case.

3. Train the model: Use the training script provided to train the recommendation model on your dataset. Adjust the training parameters as needed, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

4. Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using relevant evaluation metrics. The evaluation script provided can help you calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. Generate recommendations: Apply the trained model to generate personalized recommendations for users. You can use the provided utilities to visualize and present the recommendations in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
